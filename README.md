wp-downloadmanager-extended
===========================

A fork of Lester Chan's (@gamerz) WP-DownloadManager plugin.

@gamerz's original version is at:
http://lesterchan.net/portfolio/programming/php/#wp-downloadmanager

Synopsis
--------

This fork will have the following enhancements over @gamerz's original
version (as of v1.60):

* Add %FILE\_SIZE\_DEC%, %TOTAL\_SIZE\_DEC%, and %CATEGORY\_SIZE\_DEC% template 
  variables for decimal file sizes (kB/MB/GB/TB), as opposed to the built-in
  template variables for binary file sizes (KiB/MiB/GiB/TiB);
* Add sorting options for embedded download lists;
* When rendering the post stream, make it possible to show only the top few
  items of an embedded download list, terminated with a "Moreâ€¦" link that
  points to the single post, wherein the complete embedded download list will
  be rendered;

Sorting Embedded Downloads
--------------------------

To control the sorting of embedded downloads, specify two new attributes in the
\[download\] tag:

* *sort\_by* = the sorting criteria

  Valid values include:

    * file\_id (default)
    * file
    * file\_name
    * file\_size
    * file\_date
    * file\_hits

  Any invalid value will be ignored and the default *file\_id* will be assumed.
* *sort\_order* = ASCending or DESCending

  Valid values include:

    * asc (default)
    * desc

  Any invalid value will be ignored and the default *asc* will be assumed.
